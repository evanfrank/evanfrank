Hi, I am Evan Frank, /evanfrank, I’m interested in Physics, Data Science, and Machine Learning. My background is in coding for physics experiment and for data analysis for business report building. 

I’m currently learning how to build OCR's from scratch to be able to train on not yet avilable languages and looking into the effects of air pollution on inner city schools.
